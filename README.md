# Containers-as-servers

Scripts to create a bunch of "virtual" server machines using Docker containers.

These scripts will provide handy servers to be used for demos, testing simulating physical servers with ssh enabled.

These scripts will be perfected over time starting with a basic server with known user name and password.


## 1.BasicSSHServer_with_user_password

Create a set of basic servers each running ssh and having a known user and password for testing.
This script was created to be able to demonstrate automated ssh-key insertion using the Python Pexpect module.
